										<h2 class="major">High Score System</h2>
										<p>
										This game features a basic high score system, using input into the console, which is stored in an external file and can be loaded into the game once closed 
										and reopened. The game compares the player's current score with the last value in the high score file to determine whether the table needs to be updated. Then, 
										it takes an input for the player's name, and updates the stored table with the new score. As such, the high score table is retained even after the game is restarted.

										<h2 class="major">Ghost Pathfinding</h2>
										<p>
										The ghosts each follow a pathfinding AI, based on a target position which is calculated differently for each ghost to create visually different behaviours. 
										Whenever a ghost determines that it has reached an intersection, using a simple implementation of a raycast system that checks for collisions, it will determine 
										which path would take it closer to it's target position, and takes that path. The red ghost will always target Pacman; the pink ghost targets a 
										position a few paces in front of Pacman; the blue ghost targets a position in line with Pacman and the red ghost; the orange ghost targets Pacman 
										until it gets too close, at which point it retreats. All ghosts also have their own 'home' position that they will attempt to retreat to using the same system 
										upon activating the power pellet, or at regular intervals of the game.

										<h2 class="major">Level from File</h2>
										<p>
										This game uses an external text file to edit each level's walls and dot placements by loading it into the game as a vector of characters, x, o, O and '.', with 
										each character representing a wall, a dot, a power pellet, or empty space. This vector is then used to generate different instances of a struct for each 
										potential object, which keeps track of its own position, texture and collision. Using this, different levels can be created and, as the Ghosts AI is not hardcoded, 
										the ghosts should be able to navigate the new maze just as easily.
